The functional effect of E1836K is conflicting, as it has been reported to confer minimal reduction in binding affinity compared to wild-type in vitro (PMID: 21473589), and maintains homology directed repair similar to wild-type in cell lines (PMID: 30257991), but is also reported to confer compromised binding activity and binding specificity in in vitro assays, and unclear transcriptional activity in cultured cells (PMID: 20516115), and therefore, its effect on Brca1 protein function is unknown.",
