The functional effect of L1143P is conflicting, as it has been reported to result in Brca2 binding similar to wild-type Palb2 in cultured cells (PMID: 31586400), and does not demonstrate reduced homology-directed DNA repair activity compared to wild-type in cultured cells lacking Tp53 (PMID: 31636395), however, demonstrates decreased Rad51, Rad51c, and Xrcc3 binding in in vitro assays, and reduced Brca2 and Rad51c binding, decreased Rad51 foci formation, and impaired homology-directed DNA repair activity compared to wild-type in cultured cells (PMID: 24141787), and therefore, its effect on Palb2 protein function is unknown.",
