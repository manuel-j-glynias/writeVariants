T116A results in reduced responsiveness to Ssr2 in a reporter assay and decreased colony formation in one study (PMID: 29401647), but promotes tumor sphere formation in culture in another study despite decreased protein stability, and is resistant to Akt inhibition (PMID: 30894683), and therefore, its effect on Sox2 protein function is unknown.",
